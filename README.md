# LibraryManagementSystem

It's mine first bigger project.
I'm trying to develop my coding skills and get job in IT.

I've learned:
  - Working with databases,
  - Functions of github,
  - Interfaces usages,
  - many spring functions.
  
  
  
FUTURES:
  - New Table User
  - connect User with Book 
  - upgrade both tables
  
  
If you have some advices for me, I'm open for them.
